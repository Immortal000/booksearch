# booksearch
Book Search is a web scraping project made by using python and is powered by https://www.goodreads.com
# How it Works? 
This python program uses flask and a bit of HTML coding to take input and scraped goodreads for the particular book input and then scrapes https://www.bookdepository.com for the lowest price of the inputted book. 
# Where is the code? 
The core code which I used to build this program is available in main.py and the whole project is in the flask_app folder and the subfolders. 
# Skills I used:
(1) Webscraping with beautifulsoup\
(2) HTML layouts\
(3) Flask web development
